1371,"Ambracia (; , occasionally , Ampracia) was a city of ancient Greece on the site of modern Arta. It was captured by the Corinthians in 625 BC and was situated about from the Ambracian Gulf, on a bend of the navigable river Arachthos (or Aratthus), in the midst of a fertile wooded plain. History
It was founded between 650 and 625 BC by Gorgus, son of the Corinthian tyrant Cypselus, at which time its economy was based on farmlands, fishing, timber for shipbuilding, and the exportation of the produce of Epirus. After the expulsion of Gorgus's son Periander its government developed into a strong democracy. The early policy of Ambracia was determined by its loyalty to Corinth (for which it probably served as an entrepot in the Epirus trade), and its consequent aversion to Corcyra (as Ambracia participated on the Corinthian side at the Battle of Sybota, which took place in 433 BC between the rebellious Corinthian colony of Corcyra (modern Corfu) and Corinth).",1,88.83333333,84.48056793,0.084889,0,1,0
2995,"Archaeopteryx, sometimes referred to by its German name, """" (lit. 'original bird' or 'first bird'), is a genus of bird-like dinosaurs. The name derives from the ancient Greek (archaƒ´os), meaning ""ancient"", and (pt√©ryx), meaning ""feather"" or ""wing"". Between the late 19th century and the early 21st century, Archaeopteryx was generally accepted by palaeontologists and popular reference books as the oldest known bird (member of the group Avialae). Older potential avialans have since been identified, including Anchiornis, Xiaotingia, and Aurornis.

The Chinese room argument has been used in various ways, but it typically refers to the idea that a person cannot understand Chinese because they do not share a common language with the Chinese people. This argument is based on the assumption that the Chinese language is a completely different language to any other.

One example of this argument was used in relation to World War II. During World War II, the Japanese were known for their ability to speak and understand Chinese, which made them an important part of the war effort. However, many American soldiers were unable to speak or understand Japanese, which made it difficult for them to communicate with the Japanese troops. Consequently, the Japanese were able to achieve victory over America in World War II due to their superior understanding of Chinese.

Another example of this argument can be found in relation to translation. Many translators work with languages that are completely different from their own. For example, a translator might work with Spanish speakers, who speak a completely different language to English speakers. As a result, it is often difficult for translators to create accurate translations between languages that are completely different.

In both of these examples, the Chinese room argument is used to suggest that a person cannot understand what is",4,23.615,13.264,1.574,1,1,1

Originally concerned with infants and children, the field has expanded to include adolescence, adult development, aging, and the entire lifespan. Developmental psychologists aim to explain how thinking, feeling, and behaviors change throughout life. This field examines change across three major dimensions, which are physical development, cognitive development, and social emotional development. Within these three dimensions are a broad range of topics including motor skills, executive functions, moral understanding, language acquisition, social change, personality, emotional development, self-concept, and identity formation. Developmental psychology examines the influences of nature and nurture on the process of human development, as well as processes of change in context across time. Many researchers are interested in the interactions among personal characteristics, the individual's behavior, and environmental factors. This includes the social context and the built environment.

IGOs emerged from the efforts of world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly in 1945 to avoid the recurrence of World War II. The United Nations was founded with the goal of preventing future conflicts, and one way to achieve this was through cooperation between countries. After World War II, many countries felt that they needed a forum in which they could resolve their differences peacefully. The United Nations was created as an international organization with representatives from all nations, but it was not until 1945 that world leaders came together to discuss the idea of creating an organization that would address issues between countries. 

The first IGO was the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The IMF was created with the goal of promoting economic stability around the world. It does this by providing financial assistance to member countries in times of crisis. The IMF is also responsible for monitoring the performance of member countries and helping them to make reforms if needed.

Monism is the philosophical position that attributes oneness or singleness to any entity or concept, including individual beings, objects, and ideas. This might be called ""unitary monism"" if it regards a single thing as the source of all existence or ""plural monism"" if it regards multiple things as being essentially equivalent. In both cases, the term ""monism"" is used pejoratively to suggest that the thinker in question poses thinking about entities and concepts in an insufficiently complex way.

The history of the concept of monism is complex and has many different interpretations. One of the earliest recorded mentions of the idea comes from the 6th century BCE philosopher Parmenides, who argued that there is only one thing in the universe, which he named ""the One"". Parmenides's student Zeno of Elea also argued for monism, but in a more sophisticated way that has since been abandoned. Monism was popularised in the 3rd century BCE by Plato, who argued that there is only one kind of thing in the world: Forms.

Configuration management is a systems engineering discipline that deals with the effective management of systems and their components. CM encompasses the activities involved in planning, implementing, monitoring, and maintaining systems. CM helps ensure that the systems are configured to meet the needs of their intended users and are operated effectively. Configuration management provides a framework for integrating changes into a system, tracking changes, and managing risks.

Configuration management is used in a variety of industries, including aviation, banking and finance, defense, electronic commerce, healthcare, and manufacturing. Organizations using configuration management typically have a more successful track record than those who do not. There are several reasons for this: configuration management creates an ordered environment where changes can be tested before they are implemented into production; it facilitates collaboration among team members as changes are made; it provides transparency into the status of a system so that all stakeholders can understand how it works; and it helps prevent errors from creeping into production.

There are several different types of configuration management tools available to organizations. Some of these tools include:

A market economy is an economic system that relies on the free exchange of goods and services to generate prosperity. In a market economy, prices are determined by the forces of supply and demand in a free and open market. This allows for the efficient allocation of resources, as well as competition among producers to produce goods and services that are the best value for consumers.

The benefits of a market economy include increased economic efficiency, broad-based prosperity, and stability. These benefits are derived from two principal sources: the ability of markets to allocate resources more efficiently than any other mechanism, and the incentive structure that drives individuals and businesses to seek out the most profitable opportunities.

A market economy has many features that distinguish it from other economic systems. For example, a market economy is based on private property rights, which allows for an efficient allocation of resources and promotes innovation. Markets also produce a wide variety of goods and services that are available at different prices, which allows for a great deal of diversity and choice in the marketplace. Furthermore, in a market economy, there is competition among producers to provide goods and services that are the best value for consumers.

The doctrines are based on the principle that it is in the public interest for someone to maintain an action, especially if the plaintiff cannot afford to pay for it themselves.

The doctrine of maintenance can be traced back to English common law. Under the doctrine of trover, a plaintiff could keep an action alive by demanding that the defendant pay damages even if they had not personally acquired anything wrongfully. This allowed plaintiffs to ensure that defendants were made to pay for any losses they may have caused, even if they had not actually obtained anything themselves. The maintenance doctrine was later extended to allow defendants to keep an action alive by providing financial support to the plaintiff. This doctrine is known as champerty, and it is based on the principle that it is in the public interest for someone to maintain an action, especially if the plaintiff cannot afford to pay for it themselves.

French Canadians constitute the majority of the population in both provinces, as well as in the Canadian province of New Brunswick. They also form a significant minority in the Maritime provinces of Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island, and in Quebec City. Some French Canadians may also be found in the three other Canadian territories of Nunavut, the Northwest Territories and Yukon.

French Canadians are a culturally diverse group, with significant regional differences. They are largely Roman Catholic, though there is a significant Protestant minority as well as a growing number of secular French Canadians. French Canadians have a strong sense of community and are highly involved in community life, particularly in their rural communities. They are also highly involved in ethnic festivals and events.

French Canadians have been present in Canada since the early 17th century, when they began to arrive as refugees from religious wars in France. Many early French settlers in Canada were farmers who came to work the land that was being opened up by the British during the colonial period. In contrast to other European immigrants who came to Canada seeking opportunity, many French Canadians stayed on in Canada after gaining their independence from Britain in 1867. This was due to strong ties that had developed between Canada and France over the previous 150 years, as well as a strong sense of national identity among francophones in Canada.

Public goods can be produced in two ways: through the free rider problem or through the trust problem. The free rider problem occurs when individuals enjoy the benefits of a public good without contributing anything to its production. The trust problem occurs when individuals are unwilling to contribute to the production of a public good because they do not trust others not to take advantage of their contributions.

Public goods can be divided into two categories: collective goods and common-pool resources. Collective goods are goods that are enjoyed by the group as a whole, such as national defense or clean water. Common-pool resources are resources that are limited in quantity and easy to overuse, such as a fishing hole or a beach.

Public goods can be attractive to producers because they provide an opportunity to earn an economic profit without having to compete against other producers. However, public goods can be less attractive to consumers because they may not be able to afford to pay for them without contributing their own private resources.

Public goods can also be difficult to produce because they require cooperation between many individuals in order to be produced successfully. In order for public goods to be produced, it is often necessary",4,38.75,14.271,0.87,1,1,1

The goal of sustainable management is to create an environment and society that are capable of sustaining their natural resources, economic structures, and social systems over the long term. Sustainable management has been defined in numerous ways, but the most common definition is that it is a process that enables an organization to manage its resources in a way that does not threaten its ability to meet its objectives.

There are many different ways to achieve sustainable management. One approach is to use scientific data to make decisions about how to use resources sustainably. Another approach is to involve people from different parts of the organization in discussions about how best to use resources. A third approach is to focus on reducing environmental impact.

There are many different types of sustainable management systems. They can be classified according to their approach to sustainability:

Economic sustainability deals with how an organization can continue producing goods and services while using fewer natural resources. Social sustainability deals with how an organization can continue providing services while meeting the needs of its employees, clients, or community. Environmental sustainability deals with how an organization can continue producing goods without damaging the environment. 
There are also hybrid approaches that combine elements of more than one type of sustainability. For example, economic sustainability may include environmental and social sustainability.

The legal doctrine of diminished responsibility is based on the principle that people are responsible for their own actions. This means that, under normal circumstances, people who engage in criminal behaviour are responsible for their own actions and can be held accountable for their crimes. However, if a person has a mental disorder or disease that affects their ability to understand or control their behaviour, then they may be considered to have diminished responsibility for their actions. This means that the court may find them not guilty of the crime because they were not able to understand the full consequences of their actions.

There are two main types of diminished responsibility: partial and complete. Partial diminished responsibility refers to a situation where a person's diminished responsibility is due to a limited impairment of cognitive or emotional function. Complete diminished responsibility refers to a situation where a person's impaired cognitive or emotional function results in total incapacity to understand or control their own behaviour.

For instance, the Black Rock Skink is a species who can perform kin discrimination based on scent and form monogamous pair-bonds and a nuclear family structure. Most of these species belong to Egernia sensu stricto, and similar behaviour is also known in the related Solomon Islands skink (Corucia zebrata).

Political machines were first developed in the United States in the late 19th century, when railroads and other large businesses began to give money to politicians in order to get legislation passed that would benefit their businesses. The first political machine was the Tammany Hall political organization in New York City. Political machines became more widespread after World War I, as business interests became more organized and started to fund campaigns directly.

Political machines usually have one or more leaders, who are responsible for organizing the machine's activities. The leader typically selects candidates for office, sponsors legislation, and controls financial resources. Members of the machine often receive favors from the leader in return for their loyalty. Machines can be powerful tools for a politician, capable of winning elections on their own or by helping candidates who are affiliated with the machine win election. However, if the machine is powerful enough, it can also become a threat to democracy, as it can influence the vote of individual voters and suppress opposition votes.

Temporary work has grown in popularity in recent decades as it has become more accessible and affordable. It can provide an opportunity for people to gain experience and skills that they may not be able to find in a permanent position. It can also provide an income while someone is looking for a permanent job.

There are a variety of reasons why people may choose to do temporary work. Some may need money while they are waiting for a permanent job to become available. Others may want to take a break from their full-time job to focus on other activities. Still others may be looking for a change of scenery and new challenges.

There are several things to consider when hiring a temporary worker. First, it is important to consider the skills that the person has. If the task that the temporary worker is assigned requires specialized skills, it may be best to find someone who has those skills available.

In other words, it derives social processes (such as conflict, cooperation, identity formation) from social interaction, whereby subjectively held meanings are integral to explaining or understanding social behavior. This perspective studies the ways in which individuals shape, and are shaped by, society through their interactions. Interactionism thus argues that the individual is an active and conscious piece of the social-context system, rather than merely a passive object in their environment. It believes interactions to be guided by meanings that are attached to the self, to others with whom each individual interacts, and to situations of interaction; all of which are altered in interaction themselves.

Night vision is of lower quality than day vision because it is limited in resolution and colors cannot be discerned; only shades of gray are seen. In order for humans to transition from day to night vision they must undergo a dark adaptation period of up to two hours in which each eye adjusts from a high to a low luminescence ""setting"", increasing sensitivity hugely, by many orders of magnitude.

It portrays the events of the life of Saint Sebastian, including his iconic martyrdom by arrows. The film, which was aimed at a gay audience, was controversial for the homoeroticism portrayed between the soldiers and for having dialogue entirely in Latin. Plot
In the third century AD, Sebastian is a member of the Emperor Diocletian's personal guard. When he tries to intervene to stop one of the Emperor's catamites from being strangled by one of his bodyguards, Sebastian is exiled to a remote coastal garrison and reduced in rank to private. Although thought to be an early Christian, Sebastian is a worshipper of the Roman sun god Phoebus Apollo and sublimates his desire for his male companions into worship of his deity and pacifism.

Term life insurance is a relatively new type of life insurance. It was first introduced in the early 1900s as an innovation designed to provide a more affordable form of coverage than traditional life insurance. Today, term life insurance is one of the most popular types of life insurance. 

There are several reasons why people might choose to buy term life insurance. Perhaps you are worried about the possibility of losing your income if you were to die suddenly. Or you may be retired and want to ensure that you have enough money to live on if something happens to your income. Whatever your reasons, term life insurance is an important option to consider. 

One important thing to keep in mind when buying term life insurance is that the policy will only cover you for a set period of time. For example, a policy might cover you for five years. Once the policy has expired, the insurance company will no longer be able to help support you in case of an accident or illness. This is why it is important to carefully consider your needs and budget when shopping for term life insurance.

The experimenter establishes social norms by setting a rule‚Äîor rules‚Äîand then testing how people respond when they break the rule. The researcher then compares the results of the breaching experiment to those of a control group that does not experience any social sanctions.

The purpose of breaching experiments is to understand how, and to what extent, social sanctions (e.g., disapproval, disapproval from others) influence individual behavior. Social sanctions can have a powerful impact on behavior, both positive (e.g., compliance with rules) and negative (e.g., rebellion, cheating). Breaching experiments can be used to study a variety of different behaviors, including obedience, conformity, aggression, and altruism.

One of the most commonly used breaching experiments is the classic Stanford Prison Experiment. In this experiment, researchers set up a simulation prison and asked students to participate.

This can involve arranging between players to lose or concede matches in order to benefit someone else, or offering bribes or other incentives to referees or other officials in order to influence the outcome of a match.

There are many forms of match fixing, but the most common is when one team agrees to lose a match in return for financial compensation from the other team. This can be done for a variety of reasons, such as to gain an advantage in the tournament standings, to avoid relegation from a league, or simply to make money. In some cases, teams may also collude to fix matches in order to gain an advantage over their opponents.

Match fixing has been a problem in organized sports for decades and has led to several high-profile scandals. In 1994, prominent American basketball player Dennis Rodman was caught colluding with a team of professional gamblers to fix games. In 2000, South African cricket captain Hansie Cronje was found guilty of match fixing and sentenced to jail time.

Quantum phase transitions are extraordinarily important in the field of quantum mechanics and are responsible for the many strange and exotic phenomena that are associated with this branch of physics. They can be used to explain the behavior of matter at very small scales, and can also be exploited to create new technologies.

A quantum phase transition is a transition between two atomic or subatomic phases, where the behavior of the system changes drastically as the temperature is lowered or the pressure is increased. In general, a quantum phase transition occurs when the energy levels of a system are split into two or more discrete energy levels. This can happen, for example, when an atom or molecule forms a new structure (such as a radical ion or an ionic crystal), or when an electronic state splits into two different electronic levels.

At low temperatures, the lowest energy level is usually populated by electrons in an atom or molecule. As the temperature is lowered, however, these electrons start to thermalize, which means that they begin to distribute their energy around the atom or molecule in a way that equilibrium is restored. This process reduces the energy of the lowest energy state and increases the energy of the higher energy state.

As a result of this redistribution of energy, the atoms and molecules in a quantum phase transition regime exhibit properties that are dramatically different from those found in normal equilibrium conditions. For example, a quantum",3,62.364,104.747,1.623,1,1,1

Change control is a process that helps ensure that changes to a system are made in a controlled and safe manner. It is often used in conjunction with other quality management systems tools, such as product specification, test management, and process improvement. The purpose of change control is to ensure that the changes made to a system result in improvements to the quality of the product or service.

There are several aspects to change control, including planning, staging, controlling, monitoring, and reporting. The process of change control should be tailored to the specific type of system being modified. For example, change control procedures for a software application might be different than those for a manufacturing plant.

Planning is essential to the success of change control. The plan should identify the changes being made to the system, their objectives, and the resources required to make them. Staging is another important part of the process. It determines where the changes will be made and how they will be tested before they are implemented into the system. Controlling ensures that all changes are made in a controlled and safe manner. Monitoring ensures that all changes are executed as planned and that any adverse effects on the system are detected and corrected. Reporting provides documentation of the progress of the change control process and any problems encountered along the way.

In the years following his increased activism and involvement with labour unions, Goodwin fell under scrutiny for his opposition to military conscription during World War I.

The model is often used in organizations which have a hierarchical structure, where employees are assigned to specific levels in the organization and are expected to work towards the objectives of their level while also fulfilling the objectives of their department or division.

The organizing model has been used in a variety of organizations, including businesses, governments, and schools. It has been found to be effective in helping employees achieve their goals while also contributing to the overall success of the organization.

The organizing model was first developed by Peter Drucker in the early 1950s. He based it on his experience working at Siemens Corporation, where he was responsible for setting goals for employees working in different departments. Drucker found that it was difficult to ensure that employees were working towards the same goals, and that alignment of employee goals with organizational objectives was essential for success.

Since Drucker first developed the organizing model, various improvements have been made to it. One such improvement is the use of feedback loops. Feedback loops allow managers to monitor employee progress and adjust their goals accordingly. This ensures that employees are constantly working towards achieving organizational objectives, and that they are not left feeling frustrated or unfulfilled.

The practice of corporate transparency has become more important in recent years as investors have become increasingly interested in knowing how companies are run and what their profits are. This transparency allows investors to track a company's performance and make informed decisions about whether to invest in it or not.

There are a number of reasons why companies might choose to be transparent. Some may feel that it is important to maintain a good relationship with their shareholders, while others may believe that it is beneficial to allow the public to monitor the company's activities. Whatever the reason, being transparent is generally seen as a positive thing by investors and the public alike.

There are a number of factors that can influence corporate transparency. These include the country in which the company is located, the type of company it is, and the political climate. Certain countries, for example, are more open than others when it comes to reporting financial information.

The benefits of corporate transparency have been well documented by researchers. One study found that corporate transparency had a positive effect on stock prices and was associated with lower levels of corruption. Other studies have shown that greater levels of transparency lead to improvements in corporate governance and compliance with laws, as well as higher levels of customer satisfaction.

Legal decisions are no longer focused on a judge's analytical analysis (as in Analytical jurisprudence), but rather it is the judges themselves that become the focus for determining how the decision was reached. Political jurisprudence advocates that judges are not machines but are influenced and swayed by the political system and by their own personal beliefs of how the law should be decided. That is not to say necessarily that judges arbitrarily make decisions they personally feel should be right without regard to stare decisis. Instead they are making decisions based on their political, legal, and personal beliefs as it relates to the law.

It is estimated that problem gambling affects between 2 and 5 percent of the population in North America and Europe, and between 1 and 3 percent in Asia. The main types of problem gambling are progressive betting, multiple gambling, and slot machines.

Problem gambling can be defined as any form of gambling behaviour that is considered to be problematic, leading to negative consequences for the gambler such as financial instability, relationship breakdowns, and suicidal thoughts or attempts. Problem gambling can also lead to compulsive or addictive behaviour, as the gambler becomes increasingly dependent on their gambling habit. There are a number of different types of problem gambling, which can be broken down into three main categories: progressive betting, multiple betting, and slot machines.

Progressive betting is when a gambler starts to bets bigger and bigger sums of money on each bet, increasing the chances of losing even further. This type of problem gambling is often associated with poker players, as they are often more likely to make larger bets than others without realizing it. Multiple betting involves a gambler repeatedly betting on the same sporting event or game, even if they have no chance of winning. This can lead to financial ruin as the gambler loses large sums of money repeatedly.

However, legislation exists to stop employers from discriminating against part-time workers so this should not be a factor when making decisions on career advancement. They generally pay more than part-time jobs per hour, and this is similarly discriminatory if the pay decision is based on part-time status as a primary factor. The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) does not define full-time employment or part-time employment. This is a matter generally to be determined by the employer (US Department of Labor). The definition by the employer can vary and is generally published in a company's Employee Handbook. Companies commonly require from 32 to 40 hours per week to be defined as full-time and therefore eligible for benefits.",2,33.7,23.05091,0.097953,1,1,0

A majority decision is a winning strategy in an electoral system in which each voter has one vote. The strategy is to receive the majority of votes, or more votes than any other candidate, so that the candidate is elected with a majority of the votes. A majority decision can be used when there are multiple candidates who can win, or when there is a tie in the number of votes. If two candidates receive the same number of votes, then the candidate who receives the majority of votes is elected. In some cases, a majority decision may not be enough to win; for example, if two candidates receive equal numbers of votes but one candidate has more votes than the other by a small margin (for example, 50 votes), then that candidate is still elected even if they did not receive a majority of votes. 

When using a majority decision as a strategy, it is important to remember that not all elections are decided by a majority vote. In some cases, an election may be decided by more than 50% of the vote (for example, when there are three candidates and two of them receive 50% or more of the vote).

Cell migration is a critical process in the development of cells. Cells migrate in order to find new places to divide and grow, and to find new surfaces on which to attach themselves. Migration can also help cells find new sources of nutrients and oxygen. Cells can migrate in a number of different ways, depending on the type of cell and the location where it is located.

Migration can be subdivided into two main categories: direct migration and indirect migration. Direct migration involves the movement of cells directly from one location to another. Indirect migration happens when cells move between different areas within a same organism or between different organisms.

Direct migration involves the movement of cells from one location to another. Direct migration can be subdivided into two main categories: chemotaxis and motility.

An incomplete market can occur when there are not enough buyers or sellers available to match demand and supply. For example, if there are not enough farmers in a particular area, the market for crops will be incomplete, and prices for crops will be higher than they would be in a complete market. Incomplete markets can also arise when there are not enough goods or services available to meet the needs of all potential buyers or sellers. For example, if there is a shortage of cars on the market, buyers who want to buy a car will have to compete with sellers who want to sell their car. This can lead to high prices for cars and a shortage of cars on the market.

Market failures are situations in which the market does not work as intended and produces negative outcomes for the economy as a whole. Market failures can occur when there are not enough buyers or sellers available to match demand and supply, when there are too few goods or services available, or when buyers or sellers are not able to negotiate a fair price.market failures can have a number of negative consequences for the economy, including increased unemployment, decreased economic growth, and decreased welfare rates.

The increased lift is achieved by creating a greater angle of attack between the wing and the ground, which causes the air flowing over the wing to break away from the aircraft more quickly. This allows more air to flow over the wing and create more lift. 

An oblique wing is typically found on larger aircraft, such as commercial jets and cargo planes, because it allows them to carry heavier payloads and fly at higher speeds. It is also used on aircraft that need to avoid obstacles in their path, such as fighter jets.",2,26.4,10.89954,0.72348,1,1,1
3717895,"In economics, the Edgeworth conjecture is the idea, named after Francis Ysidro Edgeworth, that the core of an economy shrinks to the set of Walrasian equilibria as the number of agents increases to infinity. The core of an economy is a concept from cooperative game theory defined as the set of feasible allocations in an economy that cannot be improved upon by subset of the set of the economy's consumers (a coalition). For general equilibrium economies typically the core is non-empty (there is at least one feasible allocation) but also ""large"" in the sense that there may be a continuum of feasible allocations that satisfy the requirements. The conjecture basically states that if the number of agents is also ""large"" then the only allocations in the core are precisely what a competitive market would produce. As such, the conjecture is seen as providing some game-theoretic foundations for the usual assumption in general equilibrium theory of price taking agents. In particular, it means that in a ""large"" economy people act as if they were price takers, even though theoretically they have all the power to set prices and renegotiate their trades. Hence, the fictitious Walrasian auctioneer of general equilibrium,",1,102.8571429,99.94236755,-0.21786,0,1,0

Secretory proteins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Production
The production of a secretory protein starts like any other protein. The mRNA is produced and transported to the cytosol where it interacts with a free cytosolic ribosome. The part that is produced first, the N-terminal, contains a signal sequence consisting of 6 to 12 amino acids with hydrophobic side chains. This sequence is recognised by a cytosolic protein, SRP (Signal Recognition Particle), which stops the translation and aids in the transport of the mRNA-ribosome complex to an SRP receptor found in the membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum. When it arrives at the ER, the signal sequence is transferred to the translocon, a protein-conducting channel in the membrane that allows the newly synthesized polypeptide to be translocated to the ER lumen. The dissociation of SRP from the ribosome restores",1,54.4,60.40088,0.270128,0,0,0

The name arises because such a theorem ensures that there is endless scope to keep discovering new techniques to improve the way at least some specific task is done. For example, the full employment theorem for compiler writers states that there is no such thing as a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler, as such a proof for the compiler would have to detect non-terminating computations and reduce them to a one-instruction infinite loop. Thus, the existence of a provably perfect size-optimizing compiler would imply a solution to the halting problem, which cannot exist. This also implies that there may always be a better compiler since the proof that one has the best compiler cannot exist. Therefore, compiler writers will always be able to speculate that they have something to improve.

Asset freezing is a legal process which allows a creditor to seize assets of a debtor. The purpose of asset freezing is to prevent the debtor from fleeing with assets, so that the creditor may receive full payment. When a debtor enters into an agreement to repay a debt, it may be in the best interest of both the creditor and debtor to put into place measures to ensure that the debt is paid in full and that the debtor does not take any valuable assets with them when they leave. This is where asset freezing comes into play.

Asset freezing involves taking control of the assets of the debtor. This can be done through freezing the bank accounts, seizing property, or even placing bans on certain activities. The goal of asset freezing is to prevent the debtor from fleeing with valuable assets, so that the creditor may receive full payment on their debt.

There are a number of benefits to asset freezing for both the creditor and debtor. For the creditor, asset freezing allows them to get their money back sooner and ensures that the debtor cannot take away valuable assets without paying for them first. For the debtor, asset freezing can protect them from being forced into bankruptcy or from losing their home or other valuable possessions.

Christian nationalism is often used to refer to the belief that the nation should be based on the principles of Christianity. Christian nationalism has been called a ""bridge theology"" because it links the spiritual values of Christianity with the political values of nationalism.

Christian nationalism has been criticized for its exclusivist tendencies, its emphasis on a particular version of Christianity, and its support for traditional values and institutions. Christian nationalists argue that these values are essential to national identity and should be promoted in order to protect national culture. Christian nationalists also believe that Christianity is the foundation of Western civilization and should be upheld as the dominant religion in nations where it does not already exist.

A connected farm is an architectural design that uses a network of sensors and actuators to monitor and manage the environment on a large scale. This type of farm can be used for both agricultural purposes, such as growing crops, and for environmental monitoring, such as measuring water or greenhouse gas levels.

There are many different types of sensors that can be used on a connected farm, including weather sensors to track temperature, humidity, and rainfall; soil moisture sensors to monitor soil moisture levels; crop sensors to track growth; and animal sensors to track livestock movement or behavior. These sensors can be connected to computers or other devices using networks, so that they can be monitored and controlled from a central location.

One of the main benefits of using a connected farm is that it can improve the efficiency of agriculture. By tracking the conditions in different parts of the farm simultaneously, farmers can make better decisions about how to allocate resources. They can also monitor environmental conditions more closely, so that they can take appropriate action if necessary.

Another benefit of connected farms is that they can help to protect the environment. By monitoring environmental conditions closely, farmers can detect if there is any danger posed by climate",4,29.727,26.42,1.509,1,1,1

The game takes place after the events of Mega Man 8 and follows the further adventures of protagonist Mega Man as he battles a new set of Robot Masters and their malicious plans. The game features a variety of new abilities for Mega Man, as well as several returning characters from previous games.

Development on Mega Man 9 began shortly after the release of Mega Man 8, with Capcom aiming to improve upon the gameplay systems introduced in that game. The team also took advantage of the then-new Nintendo DS hardware to create a visually more advanced game than any previous entry in the series. The game was met with generally positive reviews from critics, who praised its innovative gameplay mechanics and visuals. It has since been considered one of Capcom's strongest entries in the franchise.

Mega Man 9 is an action-platform video game, played from a third-person perspective. The player controls Mega Man as he progresses through levels, defeating enemies and rescuing hostages to progress to the next area. In addition to traditional swordplay and energy blasts, Mega Man can now wall jump and use his arm cannons to fire homing missiles.

The use of compelled signalling is common in communications systems in which the sender cannot guarantee the delivery of a message. In these situations, the sender must ensure that any message sent contains the correct information in order to ensure that it is received by the intended recipient.

One example of a communication system in which compelled signalling is used is satellite communications. In satellite communications, the sender can only send messages to receivers that are located within a certain distance of the sender. Because of this limitation, satellite communications systems often use compelled signalling to ensure that messages are delivered to their intended recipients.

Another example of a situation in which compelled signalling is used is in emergency communication systems. In these systems, the sender must send a signal that alerts emergency responders to an emergency situation. Because these signals are often important, emergency responders often require that these signals be delivered without delay.

Despite its name, compelled signalling can also be used in situations in which the sender has some choice in how they communicate. For example, many mobile phone networks use compelled signalling to ensure that voice calls are delivered to their intended recipients.

The term marriage squeeze was first used in the 1970s to describe the increasing difficulty that couples were having in affording both housing and basic necessities such as food and utilities. At the time, housing prices were rising rapidly and wages were not keeping pace. The combination of these two factors led to couples being forced to make difficult choices about how they spend their money.

Since the early 2000s, the marriage squeeze has become an even more widespread problem. Inflation has increased dramatically, pushing up the cost of goods and services. At the same time, wages have not kept up with inflation, meaning that couples have less money available to them. This has led to a situation in which many couples are now having to make choices about which areas of their lives they can cut back on.

The effects of the marriage squeeze can be devastating for both couples and families. Cuts in spending can lead to financial problems for individuals and families.

There are a number of factors that can contribute to wage differential, but one of the most common is the fact that women tend to be disproportionately represented in lower-paying jobs. For example, women make up just over half of all workers in the US food service industry, but they earn only a third of what men earn in that sector. The same pattern is seen across a range of different industries: women are more likely than men to work in lower-paying jobs with fewer opportunities for advancement, and they are also less likely than men to be promoted to higher-paying positions.

One way that employers try to compensate for the wage differential is by offering higher pay rates to women than to men. This is often referred to as ‚Äúequal pay for equal work‚Äù, and it is an important principle that has been enshrined in law in many countries. However, this approach has some limitations: it is not always possible or practical to offer higher pay rates to all female employees, and it can be difficult to prove that women have been treated unfairly in the past.

Sex education has become increasingly available to all levels of society, and there is now a greater range of sexual orientations and expressions available to be explored. While traditional values continue to play a significant role in Chinese society, sexuality is increasingly seen as an individual matter that should be respected and enjoyed.

Sexuality in China has been shaped by a range of factors, including the country's history, culture, and social norms. Much of Chinese sexuality is based on traditional values such as filial piety and family honour, which place a high importance on upholding traditional gender roles. In spite of these constraints, there have been gradual changes over the years in regards to attitudes towards sex and sexual expression.

Throughout history, China has been a largely conservative society when it comes to matters of sex. Sexual activity was typically confined to within marriage boundaries and was seen as a duty that one spouse owed to the other. This mentality has gradually begun to change over the past few decades, with more people coming out in support of sexual freedom and diversity.

Today, there is a greater range of sexual orientations and expressions available to be explored in China, thanks in part to increased access to sex education.

This principle is reflected in the terminology used to describe damage: in Hebrew, damages refers both to physical injuries and to financial losses. Jewish law takes account of the fact that people will often be reluctant to compensate others for harm that they have inflicted, and therefore seeks to make compensation as easy as possible for the victim.

The Constitution of the Roman Republic was a set of guidelines and principles by which Rome's government functioned. It was first established in 509 BC, although it did not become fully implemented until 27 BC. The Constitution evolved over time, but remained largely unwritten until the early years of the Empire. The Roman Republic was eventually replaced by the Roman Empire.

The Roman Constitution was based on two principles: the principle of representative government and the principle of separation of powers. The representatives were chosen by lot from the citizenry, and they were responsible to meet regularly to discuss and vote on proposed laws. The executive power was vested in two consuls, who were elected for one year at a time. The Senate was a more powerful body, made up of wealthy landowners and businessmen who could vote on proposed laws. The consuls could veto these laws, but they could also be overruled by a vote from the Senate.

The principle of separation of powers protected individual citizens from being oppressed",2,44.929,36.405,1.197,1,1,1

The goal of transformative mediation is to help parties find common ground and build a consensus that can resolve the conflict.

The underlying legal concept of a transfer of development rights programme is the notion that all land has a bundle of property rights. It is used for controlling land use to complement land-use planning and zoning for more effective urban growth management and land conservation. Description 
The TDR process can be considered a tool for controlling urban sprawl by concentrating development. TDR is a legal mechanism offered in some local government jurisdictions as a form of development control. In the United States, TDR are also a way to avoid constitutional takings issues caused by rezoning areas that would otherwise eliminate a significant amount of value from the property. The procedure offers landowners financial incentives or bonuses for the conservation and maintenance of the environmental, heritage or agricultural values of their land. TDR is based on the concept that with land ownership comes the right of use of land, or land development. These land-based development rights can in some jurisdictions be used, unused, sold, or otherwise transferred",1,62.1,30.71898,-0.32593,0,1,0

Advancement is a common law doctrine of property law that holds that a beneficiary of an estate or trust may inherit an increased share of the assets of the estate or trust as compared to what would have been the case had the original creator of the estate or trust survived to distribute the assets. The doctrine offers beneficiaries a chance to benefit from someone else's hard work, and can result in an increased share of an estate's or trust's assets.

The doctrine is based on two principles: first, that a beneficiary is entitled to what is left after other creditors are paid; and second, that a beneficiary is entitled to what was intended by the creator of the estate or trust. In order for a beneficiary to benefit from advancement, he or she must be able to prove both principles. 

The doctrine has been applied in different ways in different jurisdictions. In some cases, advancement is automatic; in others, it must be specifically conferred by a written instrument.

The emergence of new technology, such as computers and telecommunications, had led to increased complexity and chaos in public sectors across the world.

Public sector ethics can be broadly divided into two categories: ethical principles and ethical practices. Ethical principles are general principles of moral behavior that must be followed regardless of the circumstances. Ethical practices, on the other hand, are specific actions or decisions that must be taken in specific circumstances in order to comply with ethical principles. In practice, these two categories overlap frequently, and it is often difficult to determine which set of guidelines applies in a particular situation.

One of the most important duties of public officials is to protect the public interest. This requires them to make decisions in a manner that is consistent with the principle of beneficence, which states that public officials should act in a way that is beneficial to the public as a whole. Public officials also have a duty to comply with the principle of proportionality, which states that they should take account of the potential consequences of their actions before taking any action.

Public sector ethics also require public officials to adhere to certain codes of conduct. These codes of conduct typically require public officials to avoid conflicts of interest, refrain from using their position to benefit themselves or their friends, and disclose any potential conflicts of interest prior to taking any action.

The term can be used to refer to a variety of different policies and practices, some of which are more focused on improving the welfare of animals within the agricultural industry, while others are concerned with reducing or eliminating animal exploitation altogether.

Animal protectionism has been present throughout human history, with various forms of advocacy and legislation being enacted in response to abuses against animals. In the modern era, animal protectionism has come to be seen as an important part of the animal rights movement, as it advocates for humane treatment of animals and seeks to reduce or eliminate their suffering. Animal protectionists may take a variety of different positions on various animal rights issues, but they all share a commitment to protecting animals from cruelty and exploitation.

There is significant disagreement over what constitutes animal protectionism, as there is no one definition that is universally accepted. Some people who identify as animal protectionists might not support all of the policies and practices that are typically associated with the movement, while others might consider them to be essential elements. Some common positions taken by animal protectionists include support for bans on factory farming, hunting, and euthanasia, as well as opposing experiments on animals, testing cosmetics on animals, and using animals in entertainment.

This can include identifying customer needs and wants, understanding customer behavior, and identifying potential problems with the product before they become problems. By doing this, companies can improve the quality of their products and increase customer satisfaction.

There are a number of different ways that product intelligence can be used. One way is to use it to improve the quality of the products that companies produce. For example, if a company knows that a particular type of customer tends to have problems with a particular part of the product, they may be able to redesign that part so that it is more user-friendly. Another use for product intelligence is in risk management. By understanding how customers are using the product and what problems they are encountering, companies can better predict which products will be popular and which ones will be unpopular, which can help them make better decisions about which products to develop.

There are a number of ways in which companies can target multicultural consumers. One option is to focus on specific cultural groups, such as ethnic minorities or immigrant communities.

Authentic learning has been shown to be more effective than traditional instruction methods in a variety of settings. It has been shown to be more effective in helping students develop critical thinking skills, to learn new information more effectively, and to increase their understanding of complex topics.

There are a number of reasons why authentic learning is more effective than traditional instruction methods. First, authentic learning is based on the assumption that the learner is responsible for their own learning. This means that students are given responsibility for their own progress and are encouraged to explore new ideas and concepts on their own. This type of approach helps students develop a sense of self-confidence and independence.

Second, authentic learning is based on the idea that knowledge can be learned in a variety of ways. Instead of privileging one type of instruction over another, authentic learning allows students to choose which method works best for them.

Utopian socialism is a type of social and political theory and practice that advocates the establishment of a society in which all people would be equal and live in happiness and harmony. The term was first used in the early 19th century to describe societies that were based on the principles of equality, fraternity, and liberty. Utopian socialists often envisioned an egalitarian society in which all people would share in common the fruits of their labor. They believed that through the development of democratic institutions, society could be transformed into a paradise where humans could live in peace and harmony.

The utopian socialists were not the only ones to advance this idea. Many philosophers, including Plato, Aristotle, Thomas More, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau, had also argued for the need for a society based on principles of justice and equality. However, it was the utopian socialists who developed this idea into a coherent theory. They believed that through the implementation of democratic institutions, society could be transformed into a utopia where humans could live in peace and harmony.

Utopian socialism never completely took hold in Europe or North America. However, it did play an important role in the development of modern socialism.

Administrative discretion can be used in a variety of ways. For example, administrative discretion may be used to allow for flexibility in the application of rules or regulations in order to better meet the needs of specific cases or situations. Additionally, administrative discretion may be used to allow for a certain degree of flexibility when making decisions regarding personnel matters, such as hiring and firing decisions.

Administrative discretion can also be used to allow for different interpretations of rules or regulations. For example, if a rule states that all employees must wear a certain type of clothing, an administrator may interpret this rule in a way that allows for some employees to wear clothing that is not strictly compliant with the rule. This type of discretionary interpretation is often referred to as an ""implied exception.""

The use of administrative discretion often comes with risks. For example, if an administrator uses too much discretion, this could lead to chaos and confusion in the government bureaucracy. Alternatively, if an administrator does not use enough discretion, this could lead to rules and regulations being applied in a rigid and inflexible manner.

There is some evidence to suggest that intelligence is a causal factor in educational success. Intelligence is thought to be an important predictor of academic achievement, both in terms of grades and test scores. Students who are high in intelligence are also more likely to fare well in school, regardless of their socio-economic background.

Further, intelligence has been suggested to be a key factor in predicting future success in life. Those who are high in intelligence are more likely to achieve high levels of income and wealth, as well as successful careers. In addition, they are also more likely to be successful in various fields, such as law or medicine.

Despite these positive effects, however, it is still unclear exactly how intelligence affects education outcomes. It is possible that intelligence leads students to seek out better education opportunities, or that it influences their ability to learn effectively. Additionally, it is possible that different aspects of intelligence play different roles in school success. For example, it has been suggested that intelligence may be particularly important for problem solving, which may be critical for students who are studying mathematics or science.

The concept of belief perseverance has been studied extensively by psychologists, and it has been found to play an important role in the maintenance of beliefs, particularly in the face of contradictory evidence. Belief perseverance is believed to be responsible for the apparent stability of beliefs over time, as well as the tendency of individuals to resist changes in their beliefs even when there is clear evidence to the contrary.

Belief perseverance can take several different forms. One form is called cognitive dissonance, which involves the cognitive process of reconciling two conflicting beliefs. Cognitive dissonance occurs when a person holds two opposing beliefs that are not logically compatible, and it is believed to be a motivating factor behind the maintenance of beliefs. Another form of belief perseverance is called semantic anchoring, which refers to the tendency of people to rely too heavily on initial information when making decisions. Semantic anchoring occurs when people rely too heavily on initial information when forming judgments about new information, and it can be a powerful tool for maintaining beliefs.

Despite its importance, belief perseverance has been found to be vulnerable to a number of different forms of attack. One form of attack is called cognitive bias reversal, which refers to the tendency for individuals to disregard or discount information that contradicts their current beliefs.

Factors that contribute to the success or failure of an innovation are often complex and vary from one instance to another.

One of the most important factors that can influence the rate and extent of adoption is the ability of the innovation to solve a problem that is relevant and important to a large number of people. If the problem that an innovation solves is relevant and important, then more people will likely be willing to adopt it.

Parallel task scheduling is most often used in scientific and engineering applications where the execution of multiple tasks must be done as quickly as possible to achieve a desired outcome. Applications where parallel task scheduling is used include particle physics and molecular modeling, image processing, simulation, and machine learning.

The fundamental idea behind parallel task scheduling is that the execution of multiple tasks can be done in parallel if the tasks are designed to work together asynchronously. This means that the tasks are not run together in lockstep, but rather they run at different times and take different actions. The advantage of this approach is that the overall execution time of the task can be reduced by splitting the work into smaller pieces and running them concurrently on multiple processors. 

There are a few different ways that parallel task scheduling can be implemented. The most common approach is to use a scheduler library to schedule the tasks and manage the communication between the tasks. Another approach is to use a message-passing model where each task sends messages to other tasks to update their state.

There are several challenges that must be overcome when parallel task scheduling is used in an application. One challenge is that the tasks must be designed specifically for parallel execution. Another challenge is ensuring that all of the messages sent between the tasks are properly handled",4,32.917,17.074,1.24,1,1,1

Prison plastic surgery has been a growing trend in recent years, as inmates who have undergone plastic surgery often report feeling more confident and happier after the procedures. Many inmates believe that the surgery makes them look more attractive to potential mates in jail or prison, and can help them to better cope with the stress of imprisonment.

There are many possible reasons for the increase in prison plastic surgery. In many jurisdictions, there is a shortage of qualified doctors to provide routine care to inmates, which has led to an increase in the number of patients seeking plastic surgery as an alternative option. In addition, many inmates may feel that the surgery is their only chance of escaping from their current situation, and may view it as a way to improve their chances of release.

The risks associated with prison plastic surgery are significant. The surgeries can be extremely dangerous, and patients are at risk of infection, injury, and even death. Furthermore, many inmates do not have access to proper medical facilities or equipment, which can further complicate their surgical treatment.
