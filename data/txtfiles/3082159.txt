February 1881 â 12 June 1934) was a Russian mathematician and physicist, who contributed significantly to the theory of symmetry and group theory. He is best known for his work on the mathematical structure of space, time, and matter, as well as his development of the theory of relativity.

Born in Kiev, Ukraine, Eugen Miller spent much of his childhood in the Crimea, where his father was a naval doctor. After completing high school in Kiev in 1898, he enrolled at the University of Kiev to study mathematics. While there, he became interested in physics and decided to switch to that field of study. In 1902 he graduated from the University of Kiev with a degree in physics.

After graduation, Eugen Miller worked as a university lecturer for two years before moving to Germany to continue his studies at the University of Berlin. There he began working on his doctoral dissertation and received his doctorate in 1903. His thesis was on the mathematical structure of space.

After completing his doctorate, Eugen Miller returned to Russia and accepted a position at the University of Saint Petersburg. He remained there for the rest of his life, except for a brief period during World War I when he served in the
