Yaron Tsur ((; born June 19, 1948), an historian of the Jews in the Muslim lands in the modern era, is amongst the founders of the Open University of Israel, a professor in the department of Jewish history at Tel Aviv University and a former chairperson of its graduate school of
 Jewish studies. He is a pioneer in the field of Digital Humanities in Israel and the founder of the "Historical jewish press" website. Yaron Tsur was born in Jerusalem to a German-Jewish father and to a mother of Yemenite extraction. During his childhood and youth in Jerusalem, he sojourned with his parents in the home of his Yemenite grandfather in the Nahlat Ahim neighborhood, on the border of the more established and well known Rehavia neighborhood. Subsequently, Tsur would reflect in the introduction to his Torn Community on how this unique residential setting would mold both his sense of ethnic belonging as an Ashkenazi-Mizrahi hybrid as well as his professional path as a historian.
