The Uniform Civil Code is a proposed code of civil law that would be uniform across the country. The code is being proposed by the Indian National Congress and is currently in draft form. The code would replace a variety of civil laws that vary from state to state in India. The code is intended to provide clarity and consistency in civil law across India, and to make it easier for people to access justice.

The Uniform Civil Code is currently in draft form, and there is still much work to be done before it can be implemented. The code has been criticized for being too conservative, and for not taking into account the different cultural traditions of India. However, the Indian National Congress remains committed to implementing the code, and believes that it will benefit India as a whole.
