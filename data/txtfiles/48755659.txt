a species of Iris native to the Mediterranean region.

The iris is a genus of around 100â150 species of flowering plants in the family Iridaceae. The genus is widespread across much of Europe, Asia, and North America, with a few species in Africa and South America. Many of the species are cultivated as garden plants. The name Iris comes from the Greek word for rainbow, probably because the flowers of many irises are multicolored.

Some irises are cultivated for their flowers, while others are used as garden plants or for landscaping. Some are selectively bred for various traits, such as large flowers or hardiness in cold climates. Iris sambucina is usually grown as an ornamental plant in temperate regions.
