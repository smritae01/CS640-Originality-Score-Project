road, typically less busy and with a lower speed limit, than a major highway. The term is most commonly used in the United States, where most backroads are state highways.

Backroads can be found all over the United States, and many offer unique scenery and attractions not found on more heavily trafficked highways. They can be a great way to explore an area without having to worry about getting stuck in traffic, or dealing with crowds.
