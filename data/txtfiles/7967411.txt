HaeIII is one of many restriction enzymes (endonucleases) a type of prokaryotic DNA that protects organisms from unknown, foreign DNA. It is a restriction enzyme used in molecular biology laboratories. It was the third endonuclease to be isolated from the Haemophilus aegyptius bacteria. The enzyme's recognition siteâthe place where it cuts DNA moleculesâis the GGCC nucleotide sequence which means it cleaves DNA at the site 5â²-GG/CC-3. The recognition site is usually around 4-8 bps.This enzyme's gene has been sequenced and cloned. This is done to make DNA fragments in blunt ends. HaeIII is not effective for single stranded DNA cleavage. Properties
 HaeIII has a molecular weight of 37126. After a 2-10-fold of HaeIII takes place, there is overdigestion of a DNA substrate. This results in 100% being cut, more than 50% of fragments being ligated, and more than 95% being recut. Heat inactivation comes at about 80 Â°C for 20 minutes. The locus of the HaeIII enzyme is on
