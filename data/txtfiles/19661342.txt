formal diplomatic relations since the Iranian Revolution in 1979. The two countries have had limited trade links since the late 1970s, but their ties have improved in recent years as Iran has become more open to the world.

Iran and Saudi Arabia share a long border, with both countries having sizeable populations on the other side. Iran and Saudi Arabia are both members of the Arab League and OPEC. They are also close allies of the United States and have a strong military relationship. Iran and Saudi Arabia have had sporadic diplomatic relations since 1979, when Iranian revolutionaries overthrew the monarchy. The two countries have not had formal diplomatic relations since then. However, there has been increased trade between the two countries in recent years as Iran has become more open to the world. In 2006, Saudi Arabia agreed to invest $10 billion in Iranian oilfields, and in January 2007, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad visited Saudi Arabia.
