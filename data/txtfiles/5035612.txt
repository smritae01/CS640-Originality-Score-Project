Gary Patrick Waddock ( ; born 17 March 1962) is a former professional footballer. He is assistant head coach of Cambridge United. He formerly managed Queens Park Rangers, Aldershot Town, Wycombe Wanderers and Oxford United, and has previously worked at MK Dons as Head of Coaching and Portsmouth as assistant and caretaker manager. He grew up in Alperton, a suburb of Wembley, and attended Alperton High School. Playing career
 During his playing career, Waddock appeared professionally (predominantly as a midfielder) for six different clubs. He earned 21 international caps for the Republic of Ireland, scoring three goals in the process. Waddock was named by Jack Charlton in the squad for the 1990 FIFA World Cup, but having travelled to the pre-tournament camp in Malta, he was dropped at the last minute in favour of Alan McLoughlin, seen as better cover for players nursing injuries. Years later Charlton later said that he should have kept Waddock and dropped veteran striker Frank Stapleton instead.
