state in which an individual experiences a sharp and sudden increase in their sense of moral outrage. Moral shock can be induced by events that conflict with the individual's usual moral beliefs, or by encountering someone or something who is morally opposed to their own values.

Moral shock is often associated with moral Disorientation, which is a feeling of confusion and disorientation about one's own moral beliefs and values. Moral Disorientation can lead to Moral Reorientation, or a change in one's moral beliefs and behavior.
