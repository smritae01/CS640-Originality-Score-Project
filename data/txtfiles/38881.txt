[ËpÃ¦lermo] or [pÃ¦ËlÉËrmo]) is a city in Sicily, Italy, and the capital of the metropolitan area of Palermo. It is the largest city in Sicily, with a population of about 270,000, and is the central city of the Metropolitan City of Palermo, with a population of over 1 million.

Palermo is located in the central-eastern part of the island of Sicily, on the Mediterranean Sea. The city was founded by Phoenicians in 734 BC as Ziz, one of a number of Phoenician settlements in Sicily. The Roman Republic acquired it in 238 BC and renamed it Palermo after its founder, Pallas Athena. The city became an important center of trade and culture under the Byzantine Empire, and later passed through Muslim hands before becoming part of the Kingdom of Sicily in 1071.

Palermo was sacked by Norman mercenaries in 1084 AD and by the Aragonese in 1143 AD. In 1409, King Ladislaus I of Naples gave Palermo to his brother Count Alfonso V of Aragon as part of his dowry.
