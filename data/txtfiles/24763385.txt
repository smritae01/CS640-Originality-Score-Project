welding, is a welding technique in which a weld is produced by the use of a torch heated on a flat heat resistive surface. 

The technique can be used to join metals, most notably steel and aluminium, where a welding arc is formed between the tip of the welding electrode and the workpiece. The heat from the welding arc melts the metal at the weld joint, creating a strong joint.
