that is encoded by the "ELA" gene. Elastase is an enzyme that hydrolyzes proteins. Pancreatic elastase is a serine protease that specifically degrades pancreatic extracellular matrix proteins.

Pancreatic elastase is a serine protease that specifically degrades pancreatic extracellular matrix proteins. This protein has been shown to be involved in the development of pancreatic cancer, and plays a role in the progression of the disease. Pancreatic elastase has also been shown to be involved in the degradation of other proteins, such as fibronectin and laminin.
