1066â1086) was a Welsh mercenary soldier, who fought in the Norman Conquest of England, and the Second Crusade.

Einion ap Collwyn was born in the early 12th century, probably in Gwynedd. He is first mentioned in 1066, when he fought for the Norman forces invading England alongside Robert Curthose, the son of William the Conqueror. In 1070 he accompanied Robert on his campaign to Italy, where he distinguished himself at the Battle of Civitate. On his return to England in 1072, he participated in the siege of York.

In 1084 Einion joined the Second Crusade, led by Emperor Henry IV, crossing Anatolia with a force of Welsh mercenaries. He appears to have died soon after reaching Jerusalem, as there is no record of his further activity during the campaign.
