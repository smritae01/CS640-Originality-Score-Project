rescue operation in the Canadian Arctic carried out from May to September 1980. The search was for a U.S. Air Force EC-130 aircraft that had gone missing in bad weather on a flight from Resolute Bay to Edmonton, Alberta.

The aircraft was found nine months later, on September 7, 1980, by a Canadian air force aircraft approximately 10 miles north of the search area. The aircraft had crashed into the Arctic Ocean and had sunken below the surface.
