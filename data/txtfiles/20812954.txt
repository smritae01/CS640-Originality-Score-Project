in England from 1875 to 1965. It served the sons of the gentry and the aristocracy, and produced a number of notable alumni, including the poet Siegfried Sassoon, the composer Gustav Holst, and the historian A. J. P. Taylor.

The Elvian School was founded in 1875 by two friends, Frederick J. Furnivall and Charles C. Walcott, as an independent boarding school for boys in Rotherfield, Hampshire. Originally named after the mythical King Elvian of Colchester, it soon became known as the "Elvian School". It was one of England's most highly respected secondary schools for boys and its alumni included six Prime Ministers (four of whom were Conservative), fourteen Nobel Prize recipients, and many leading military officers and diplomats.

In 1965, after more than a century of operation, the Elvian School closed its doors due to financial difficulties. Today, the site is occupied by a housing estate.
