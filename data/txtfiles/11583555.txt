The PodilskoâVyhurivska line formerly the PodilskoâVoskresenska line will be the fourth addition to Kyiv's metro system. Presently under construction, when finished, it will contain 16 stations and be approximately 20 kilometres long. This line will serve as an important relief for existing and over-stretched transfer points. The first segment is due to open after 2022, with the project being fully completed by 2030. This line is colored orange on the maps. Plan and construction
 Like most Kyiv Metro lines, it will open in a set of stages. The first is planned to be a three-station deep-level segment which will run from the existing Vokzalna station of the SviatoshynskoâBrovarska line northwards to Hlybochytska. This will be a transfer to the Lukianivska station on the SyretskoâPecherska line. The second segment will then continue eastwards to the Podil region of Kyiv, across the Dnieper River on a combined automobile bridge through Trukhaniv Island, and into the northern left-bank districts.
