Neonatal hypoglycemia occurs when the neonate's blood glucose level is less than the newborn's body requirements for factors such as cellular energy and metabolism. There is inconsistency internationally for diagnostic thresholds. In the US, hypoglycemia is when the blood glucose level is below 30Â mg/dl within the first 24 hours of life and below 45Â mg/dl thereafter. In the UK, however, lower and more variable thresholds are used (<18Â mg/dl at any time OR baby with abnormal clinical signs and a single value <45Â mg/dl OR baby at risk of impaired metabolic adaptation but without abnormal clinical signs and a measurement <36Â mg/dl and remaining <36Â mg/dl at next measurement). The neonate's gestational age, birth weight, metabolic needs, and wellness state of the newborn has a substantial impact on the neonates blood glucose level. There are known risk factors that can be both maternal and neonatal. This is a treatable condition. Its treatment depends on the cause of the hypoglycemia. Though it is treatable, it can be fatal if gone undetected. Hypoglycemia is the most common metabolic problem in
