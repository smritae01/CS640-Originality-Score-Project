a series of experimental motor coaches built by Linke-Hofmann-Busch (LHB) between 1954 and 1962. They were the first prototypes to be built using the then-new monocoque construction technique.

The LHB prototype coaches were designed to test the feasibility of using monocoque construction in local traffic coach design, and to explore the potential benefits of this technology. They were also intended as a stepping stone towards the development of a new generation of local traffic coaches.

The LHB prototype coaches were initially built as two-car sets, and they were later modified to include three cars. All of the LHB prototype coaches were powered by petrol engines, and they had a range of approximately .

The LHB prototype coaches were initially very successful, but they eventually proved to be too expensive to be commercially viable. Consequently, no further examples of LHB prototype cars were ever built.
