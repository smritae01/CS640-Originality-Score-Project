evolved to live in extreme environments. The Antarctic environment is one of the most inhospitable on Earth, with temperatures averaging -50 degrees Celsius and little to no sunlight. This has led to the evolution of many unique species of animals.

The wildlife of Antarctica is diverse, with over 1,000 species of animals living in the region. The most common animal in Antarctica is the penguin, which numbers in the millions. Other common animals include seals, skuas, lemurs, and rodents. The region is also home to a number of rare and endangered species, including the Southern Right whale, the Emperor penguin, and the AdÃ©lie penguin.
