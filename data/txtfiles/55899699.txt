Commissioner John Aiken Carleton (21 May 1848 â 21 June 1934) was a contemporary of William Booth and played a significant role in the early days of The Salvation Army. He was the first Chair of the Salvation Army International Musical Board. But he is more well known for his idea of giving up pudding that gave rise to Self-Denial week, something still in existence to this day. He was in the first cohort to be awarded the Order of the Founder in 1920. Salvation Army Music
 Carleton was a capable musician and served as a songster leader at Penge for 28 years. William Booth sought to centralize and control the creativity and compositions of the Salvation Army brass band, which were quickly becoming synonymous with the movement. He formed an International Musical Board (later called International Headquarters Music Board) and appointed Carleton as the first chair. The Board served to standardize and censor the music of the Salvation Army, much to the frustration of and criticism by Richard Slater, who commanded the Musical Department.
