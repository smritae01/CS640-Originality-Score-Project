 Born in 1971, Arlotta grew up in Capriva del Friuli, Italy. She attended liceo scientifico Duca degli Abruzzi in Gorizia. She earned an M.S. in biochemistry from the University of Trieste and her Ph.D in molecular biology from the University of Portsmouth under the mentorship of Santa J. Ono in 2000. The title of her Ph.D thesis was "The high mobility group protein I-C: transcriptional regulation and involvement in the formation of lipomas in transgenic mice". She then completed her postdoctoral research at Harvard Medical School under the mentorship of Jeffrey Macklis at Harvard Medical School.
