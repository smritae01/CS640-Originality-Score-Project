 The Fessenden House is located in Royalton village, at the corner of Bridge Street and Vermont Route 14. It fronts on a former alignment of Route 14, which provides access to the bridge and is separated from the current alignment by an elongated triangular green. The house is 2-1/2 stories in height, with a gabled roof, interior brick chimneys, clapboard siding, and a stone foundation. It has typical Georgian style massing, with a five-bay front facade. Sash windows occupy most of the bays, with the center entrance framed by a Federal period surround consisting of flanking pilasters rising to a gabled partial pediment that surmounts a half-round leaded transom window. First-floor windows are topped by simple projecting cornices. The interior has many high-quality period finishes, including elements of basement
