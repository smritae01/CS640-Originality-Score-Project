â 21 February 2018) was an English mathematician, physicist and designer of Formula One racing cars.

Newey was born in Salford, England, the son of Jacqueline and Francis Newey. He was educated at The King's School, Chester and then studied mathematics at the University of Cambridge, graduating in 1983 with a first-class honours degree in mathematics. He then undertook postgraduate studies at the University of Oxford, where he earned his DPhil in 1985.

Newey began his career as a research fellow at the University of Cambridge, before moving to the University of Oxford in 1986 as a lecturer in mechanical engineering. He became a professor at Oxford in 2002, and retired from his teaching post in 2016.

Newey's research focused on the design of Formula One racing cars. His innovations included the use of computational fluid dynamics to improve car performance and the introduction of active suspension to reduce lap times. He was also responsible for the development of the F1 driver helmet and cockpit protection system.

Newey was diagnosed with lung cancer in December 2017, and died from the disease on 21 February 2018 at the age of 60.
