 Cruentis began in 2012, between two friends Tyler DeMerchant on Vocals/Bass and Jesse Dean on Vocals/Guitars. The band added on Matt Sargent on Lead Guitars shortly afterward. The band, despite forming in 2012, remained musically silent until 2016. The band then recorded their debut album, Cold Stone, with the title track and "The Blood That Divides" being released as singles prior to the album's release. Cold Stone was released independently. Following the release of the album, they added Daniel Willsmore on drums, and recorded an EP, Dichotomy. However, following the EP's release, both Sargent and Willsmore seemingly departed from the band, leaving only founding members DeMerchant and Dean left in the band. The band would continue on as a two-piece, as both understood how to perform
