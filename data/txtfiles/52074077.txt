November Group (Marraskuun ryhmÃ¤) was an association of Finnish expressionist artists, gathered around Tyko Sallinen. The group was founded in time when Finland declared its independence from Russia and the members of the November Group were sometimes aggressively nationalistic in outlook, creating a distinctively Finnish form of Expressionism. The November group caused the greatest ever uproar in Finnish art. In the Finnish art community of its age it represented everything that was ugly, incompetent, distorting and primitive. Today the movement is considered one of the most important and influenced movements in Finnish art. Members of the group included Tyko Sallinen, Marcus Collin, Alvar CawÃ©n, Juho Rissanen and Gabriel Engberg. These five had a group exhibition 17 November to 5 December 1917, and in decided to found a group during that exhibition. Other members of the group were Eero Nelimarkka, Juho MÃ¤kelÃ¤, WÃ¤inÃ¶ Aaltonen, Ilmari Aalto, Hannes Autere, Kalle Carlstedt, Mikko Carlstedt, Ragnar Ekelund, Uuno Eskola,
