Charlton Ehizuelen (born 30 November 1953) is a Nigerian former track and field athlete who competed in the long jump and triple jump. He set personal bests of and for the events, respectively. The latter mark from 1975 remains the Nigerian indoor record. As an international competitor, he became the first person to win both long jump and triple jump titles at the All-Africa Games, doing so at the 1978 Games in Algiers. He was also a double winner at the one-off West African Games held in 1977. At the inaugural 1977 IAAF World Cup he was a long jump bronze medallist and triple jump fourth-placer. He was one of only three members of the African team to reach the podium that year, alongside Ethiopians Miruts Yifter and Eshetu Tura. He represented Africa again at the 1981 IAAF World Cup, but was eighth in the long jump on that occasion. His international career on the highest stage was stymied by Nigeria's boycotts of the 1976 Montreal Olympics where he was a favorite for a medal and the 1978 Commonwealth Games, done in response to South African apartheid.
