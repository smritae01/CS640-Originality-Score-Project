Colossal is an American indie rock band from Elgin, Illinois, United States, formed in 2001. They have one EP and one full-length, and have appeared on multiple compilations. Their lyrics and musicianship display a depth much like that found in math rock. Band history
 Colossal was formed in Elgin, Illinois, in late 2001 by friends Jeff Feucht (bass), Jason Flaks (trumpet, guitar, vocals), Rob Kellenberger (drums, backup vocals), and Pat Ford (vocals, guitar). They began playing shows in spring of 2002 in and around Chicago, Illinois. Asian Man Records released their debut, a self-titled, six-song EP (also known as "Brave the Elements"), in January 2003. The bandâs genre-crossing ways were already evident on the EP, as the songs fuse elements of punk, jazz, and jangly pop with a focused singularity. The sound is intricate and dense but still accessible and unified. The EP received universal critical acclaim and attendance at shows steadily increased. The band's first tour, of eastern Canada and the East Coast, was that summer.
