typically exhibited in the form of insistence on adult-only rights, privileges, and opportunities. It is a form of narcissism that manifests itself in a disregard for or contempt for the well-being and concerns of others, as well as a persistent belief that adults are superior to children or adolescents.

Adultcentrism can be harmful to individuals, societies, and the environment. It can lead to discrimination and abuse against children and adolescents, as well as a lack of empathy and concern for their wellbeing. It can also contribute to social isolation and loneliness, as well as a lack of understanding and respect for other cultures.

Adultcentrism is a complex phenomenon that has been studied extensively by psychologists and social scientists. There is still much to be learned about its origins, effects, and possible ways to combat it. However, efforts to reduce its prevalence are beginning to yield positive results.
