RÃ¸dkleiva is a hill located in Nordmarka in Oslo, Norway. It was taken into use as a slalom hill in 1947 and was used for the combined event of the Holmenkollen Ski Festival eleven times between 1947 and 1963. It hosted the slalom events for the 1952 Winter Olympics, which saw a crowd of at least 25,000 spectators. The Olympic course was long and had a drop of. The course gradually fell into disrepair and was closed in 1988. The hill has several times been launched as a potential location for a ski jumping hill. The first idea came in 1912; later options to replace Holmenkollbakken resurfaced during the 1930s and the 1970s, but were quickly rejected. With the closing of Midtstubakken, Oslo's normal hill, in the late 1980s, RÃ¸dkleiva was again launched as a jumping hill. VikersundbakkenâNorthern Europe's only ski flying hillâwas in the late 1990s proposed replaced by a new hill in RÃ¸dkleiva. The plans received support from the Norwegian Ski Federation, but the municipality and state were not interested in issuing grants
