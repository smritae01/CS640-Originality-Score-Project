for Investigative Reporting, is a watchdog organization that investigates alleged violations of the stateâs public trust.

Our work is inspired by the belief that democracy and accountability require transparency and public scrutiny of government actions. We pursue investigations that hold public officials accountable for their actions and help to ensure that government serves the people rather than the powerful.

We are a nonprofit news organization, funded by contributions from our readers and other supporters. We do not accept government advertising or contracts.

We have a staff of reporters and analysts who cover a wide range of issues, including environmental justice, public health, financial accountability, and education reform. Our work has led to major investigations of corruption in state government, fraud in the California budget system, and misuse of state funds by private businesses.
