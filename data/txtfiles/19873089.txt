The Horrorist was an occult and horror-themed comic book limited series written by Jamie Delano, with art by David Lloyd, published by the DC Comics imprint Vertigo. It was a spin-off of Vertigo's popular Hellblazer series and features the character John Constantine. The book consisted of two 52-page issues without advertisements, published in December 1995 and January 1996 respectively. Plot
 The story revolves around Angel, who as a young girl was rescued from war-torn Mozambique, and who witnessed the most unspeakable war crimes and atrocities. As an adult, in the present day, Angel becomes a "Horrorist", that is, someone who redistributes pain by unveiling to people the suffering of others. She travels America's roadways, annihilating people's solipsistic existence by exposing them to the unfettered scope of true oppression, famine and murder. Sometimes this takes the form of altered reality, such as several boys playing in the snow dying from landmines that were not there earlier.
