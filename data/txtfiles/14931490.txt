house of the city of Verona, Italy. It is considered one of the most important and prestigious opera houses in the world. The theatre was built by Giorgio Vasari in 1580 and has been used for operas, ballets, concerts and other performing arts since that time.

The Teatro Filarmonico is located in the heart of the city, on the Piazza Bra in front of the Duomo. The building was originally built as a church, with three aisles and two transepts. In 1686, Pope Innocent X decided to convert it into an opera house, and added an auditorium on the southern side. The original faÃ§ade was modified in the 18th century by Francesco Maria Ricci. The building was damaged during World War II but has since been restored.

The Teatro Filarmonico is one of Verona's most important tourist attractions and is regularly used for concerts, opera and ballet performances. It is also occasionally used for plays and other theatrical events.
