Toby Sedgwick (born 16 August 1958) is a British movement director, actor, and theatre choreographer. He achieved critical acclaim for his expressive "horse choreography" for life-size puppets used in War Horse (2007), which played at West End's New London Theatre, Broadway's Vivian Beaumont Theater and Toronto's Princess of Wales Theatre. For the latter, Sedgwick won a 2008 Laurence Olivier Award for Best Theatre Choreographer and a 2012 Dora Mavor Moore Award for Outstanding Choreography in a Play or Musical. Due to its success, the play went on a 30-city tour in the United States and was also produced in Australia and in Germany, opening late in 2013, just before the centenary of the first world war.
