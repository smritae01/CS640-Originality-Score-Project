of analytic philosophy by the American philosopher Raymond Geuss. It is a radical critique of the analytic tradition, which Geuss argues has produced largely incorrect theories about the nature of knowledge. 

Prior Analytics is divided into four parts: "The Nature of Knowledge," "The Nature of Belief," "The Nature of Judgment," and "The Nature of Proof." Geuss argues that the traditional theories of knowledge, belief, judgment, and proof are all flawed. He claims that these theories are based on false intuitions about the nature of knowledge, belief, and judgment. 

Geuss's theory of prior analytics is based on two main claims: first, that there is no single type of knowledge that is universally valid; second, that there are different types of knowledge that can be used to understand different areas of life.
