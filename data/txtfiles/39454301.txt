The film was selected as the Croatian entry for the Best Foreign Language Film at the 86th Academy Awards, but it was not nominated. Plot
 In 1977, fifteen years before the Bosnian War ravaged their lives, Halima's (Alma Prica) niece Safija (Olga PakaloviÄ) became pregnant by Slavomir (Mijo JuriÅ¡iÄ), a Serb man. Beaten and ostracized by her Bosniak family, Safija gave the infant boy to the childless Halima to raise, telling Slavomir it was stillborn. Twenty-three years later, the devastating war has ended. Bodies are being identified through DNA samples and returned to families for burial. Halima's husband is found, but Mirza's bones cannot be returned to her without a blood sample. And that would have to come from Safija
