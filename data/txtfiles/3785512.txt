Chipknip (a portmanteau of chip card and knip, Dutch for purse) was a stored-value payment card system used in the Netherlands. Based on the Belgian Proton system, it was started by Interpay on October 26, 1995 as a pilot project in the city of Arnhem and a year later rolled out countrywide. Chipknip was taken over by Currence due to a restructuring on May 17, 2005 who managed it with their licensees until its discontinuation on January 1, 2015. The Chipknip was primarily used for small retail transactions, as the card could contain a maximum value of 500 euros. The money needs to be transferred from a card holders main bank account using a loading station who were generally located next to ATMs. In 1996, The Postbank left the Chipknip project and started the Chipper project with other organisations such as PTT Telecom to compete with the Chipknip until 2001, when it merged into the Chipknip system.
