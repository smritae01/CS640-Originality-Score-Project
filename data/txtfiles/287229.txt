In mathematics, specifically differential calculus, the inverse function theorem gives a sufficient condition for a function to be invertible in a neighborhood of a point in its domain: namely, that its derivative is continuous and non-zero at the point. The theorem also gives a formula for the derivative of the inverse function.
 In multivariable calculus, this theorem can be generalized to any continuously differentiable, vector-valued function whose Jacobian determinant is nonzero at a point in its domain, giving a formula for the Jacobian matrix of the inverse. There are also versions of the inverse function theorem for complex holomorphic functions, for differentiable maps between manifolds, for differentiable functions between Banach spaces, and so forth. Statement
 For functions of a single variable, the theorem states that if is a continuously differentiable function with nonzero derivative at the point ; then is invertible in a neighborhood of , the inverse is continuously differentiable, and the derivative of the inverse function at is the reciprocal of the derivative of at :
