Brandon Nakashima (born August 3, 2001) is an American professional tennis player. He has been ranked as high as world No. 62 in singles by the Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP), which he first achieved in November 2021. He also reached a career-high doubles ranking of No. 396 that same month. As a junior, Nakashima was ranked as high as No. 3 in the world. In 2018, he won two titles on the International Tennis Federation (ITF) junior circuit and went on to win that year's ITF Junior Masters, the year-end tournament for the top-ranked junior singles players. He later enrolled at the University of Virginia to play collegiate tennis, but chose to forgo his remaining years of eligibility after his first year. As a professional, Nakashima broke into the top 100 in August 2021 after reaching his first two ATP Tour finals. His breakout success qualified him for the 2021 Next Generation ATP Finals, the year-end tournament for the top-ranked singles players aged 21 and under, where he made it to the semifinals, and he closed the season at a career-high ranking of No. 62.
