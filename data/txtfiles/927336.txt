that is located in the northern hemisphere. It lies near the northwestern rim of the huge walled plain informally named Piccolomini, and its eastern rim forms the eastern end of the Valles Marineris. The crater is named after Piero de' Piccolomini, a 15th century Italian humanist and politician.

By convention these features are identified on lunar maps by placing the letter on the side of the crater midpoint that is closest to Piccolomini.
