political newspaper published between 1919 and 1920. The paper was founded by supporters of Eugene V. Debs, the imprisoned president of the American Federation of Labor, and was intended as a vehicle for his activism.

The New York Communist was published twice a week, and had a circulation of about 2,000. Its editorial policy was sharply critical of both the Bolshevik regime in Russia and the American Federation of Labor. Although it never attained much popularity, the paper helped to publicize Debs's political ideas.

The paper was shut down in 1920 after Debs's release from prison, and subsequently disappeared from history.
