 Born in Halifax, West Yorkshire, as a child he moved with his family to Florence, Nova Scotia, a coal town located near Sydney Mines on Cape Breton Island. When his father enlisted in the armed forces in 1916, at age 11 he helped to support his family by working in the coal mines during the evening shift and continuing at school during daytime. As a teenager he was coached by his father and won local races. He went on to win the Canadian five-mile (8Â km) championship when it was held in Halifax in 1925. He also won the Halifax Herald competition in the same year. As a young man, Miles worked various temporary jobs, including a stint in northern Ontario. When he won the Halifax races, he was employed in a colliery blacksmith's shop. He was then offered employment with the British Canadian Cooperative Store. For them, Miles delivered groceries to local customers and country stores by horse and wagon. To stay in shape he would run behind the wagon wearing heavy boots.
