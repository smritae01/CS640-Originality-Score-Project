the Indianapolis Motor Speedway on May 29, 1985. The race was won by A. J. Foyt, driving a Chevrolet driven by manager/owner Ray Evernham. Al Unser, Jr. finished second in a Penske Racing Ford, and Cale Yarborough finished third in a Lola-Ford.

The race was contested over 267 laps of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's 2.5-mile oval. It was the first time that the Indy 500 had been televised live in its entirety; the race was also the first time that the race was broadcast in high definition. The race's official attendance was 281,070, making it the largest crowd to ever witness an Indy 500 event.

In 1983, after 34 years of competition, reigning champion Mario Andretti retired from racing at the age of 48. His last competitive event would be the 1983 Indianapolis 500; Andretti finished sixth in his last Indy 500 race.

Two other drivers who would go on to win numerous races during their careers made their Indy 500 debuts at this race: Kenny Brack (driving for Team Penske) and Rick Mears (driving for McLaren).
