The Labour Party Conference is the annual national conference of the UK Labour Party. It is formally the supreme decision-making body of the Party. The conference is traditionally held on the final week in September during the British party conference season when the House of Commons is in recess, after the Liberal Democrats and before the Conservative Party have held their conferences. Labour is one of few British parties to use their annual gathering for voting and policy resolution. The conference opens on a Sunday and finishes the following Wednesday, usually with an address for the Deputy Leader of the Labour Party, although some exception - including 2016 - have been made. This means that the Leader's address is usually held on the Tuesday. Conference decisions
