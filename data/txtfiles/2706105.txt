The film tells the story of two backpackers, Josh (John Jarratt) and Sarah (Karen Gillan), who become stranded in the outback after their car breaks down. They are attacked by a pack of wild wolves and Josh is brutally killed. Sarah manages to escape, but is traumatized by her experience. She returns to the town to report Josh's death, but no one believes her. Two years later, Sarah has moved on and is dating a local guy, Jack (Dean Norris). When Jack goes out drinking with his friends, Sarah follows them to Wolf Creek Bar, where she sees Josh among the customers. She screams and runs away, returning to town where she tells Jack what she saw. The police investigate and find evidence that points to Josh's killer being one of Jack's friends, but they can't prove it. Sarah decides to return to Wolf Creek to confront her fears head-on.
