beyond the solar system, located around the star Kepler-10. It was announced in May 2016 by the Kepler team and confirmed in October 2016 by follow-up observations.

Kepler-10 is a sun-like star located about 1,000 light years from Earth in the constellation Cygnus. It is one of the few stars that has been monitored by Kepler, which found numerous planets transiting its surface. In particular, Kepler-10b was found to have two transits, indicating that it may be a terrestrial planet. Further observations were needed to confirm this.
