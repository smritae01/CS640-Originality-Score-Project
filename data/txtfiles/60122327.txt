Asta Krause; October 5, 1875, Frankfurt am Main, Germanyâdied February 10, 1954, Bad Homburg) German chemist who contributed to the development of organic chemistry and synthesis.

Von Mallinckrodt-Haupt studied chemistry at the universities of GÃ¶ttingen and Munich, receiving his doctorate from the latter in 1899. He then worked at Bayer AG as a research chemist, and in 1910 he was appointed professor of organic chemistry at the University of Freiburg. In 1936 he moved to the University of Berlin, where he became emeritus professor in 1954.

Von Mallinckrodt-Haupt is noted for his work on organic synthesis, which included the development of methods for the synthesis of complex organic molecules. His most important achievement was the synthesis of 1,2-diaminocyclohexane (1912), a key compound in the development of modern synthetic chemistry.
