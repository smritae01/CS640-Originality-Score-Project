of express passenger trains operated by the Southern Railway in the United States. Originally designed as a high-speed commuter train, the class was rebuilt in the late 1960s and early 1970s to operate at a higher speed on the southern California San Diego line.

The class was generally composed of four cars, with each car having a capacity of 235 passengers. The trains were powered by a single GE C30-7 locomotive, and were capable of speeds up to 110 miles per hour (177 km/h).
