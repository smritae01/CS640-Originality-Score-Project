 He was born as Isaak-Leib Fishelevich Wolkenstein in 1858, presumably in Taganrog. Wolkenstein was brother of , who was a Russian lawyer. Lev Wolkenstein studied at Taganrog Classical Male Gymnasium at the same time as Anton Chekhov. When Chekhov was in seventh grade and Wolkenstein was in undergraduate eighth grade, all of the students in Wolkenstein's class except him refused to write an essay prescribed for them. This caused conflict between Wolkenstein and his classmates. One of them called Wolkenstein as "zhyd" and Wolkenstein slapped him in the face. For this assault and battery, Wolkenstein was expelled from gymnasium. After that, Chekhov induced classmates to write a collective statement that all of them would leave the gymnasium if Wolkenstein was not reinstated. That had an effect, and he was reinstated and later graduated from gymnasium.
