Ramsay Street is the fictional cul-de-sac in which the characters of the Australian soap opera Neighbours live. The street is set in the equally fictional Melbourne suburb of Erinsborough. Neighbours storylines primarily centre on the residents of the Street, which was named after Jack Ramsay, the grandfather of original character Max Ramsay (Francis Bell). Only six houses on the street are featured on a regular basis; numbers 22 to 32. Number 34 was featured for the first time in 2018. The cul-de-sac is at the end of a long street and the rest of the houses are on the other side of the main road which bisects it. A storyline within the show saw the name of the street nearly changed to Ramsbottom Street. Harold Bishop (Ian Smith) led a protest against it and won. Pin Oak Court, in Vermont South (at ), is the real cul-de-sac that doubles for Ramsay Street. All of the houses featured in the show are real and the residents allow Neighbours to shoot external scenes in their front and back gardens. Neighbours has been filmed in Pin Oak Court since the series began in 1985 and it has since become popular with
