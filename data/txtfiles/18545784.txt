 In the JanuaryâFebruary 2010 issue of (French magazine) Trad' Mag, on the occasion of the album re-release by the Gael-Linn label, folk critic Philippe Cousin awarded Ceol Aduaidh full marks (giving the album a "Bravo!!!" award), calling it a Â«recording that is a historical milestone in the early 1980s presaging the beginnings of AltanÂ» and stating: Â«On fully remastered Ceol Aduaidh, fiddler and singer MairÃ©ad NÃ­ Mhaonaigh and flutist Frankie Kennedy perform some of the typical Donegal dances such as Mazurkas ("Shoe the Donkey"), Highlands and Germans along with the inevitable Jigs and Reels.
