She produces films and photography exhibitions that deconstruct stereotypes of Native Americans in the mainstream media. Recent projects include âLegacy of Exiled NDNZ,â inspired by the 1961 Kent Mackenzie film The Exiles, which examines the inter-generational impact of the Indian Relocation Act of 1956 in historical and contemporary Los Angeles, and âReal NDNZ Re-Take Hollywood,â which recreates iconic movie star portraits from the days of classical Hollywood cinema featuring contemporary Native American actors. Pamela was born to the Tachiiânii clan (Red Running into the Water, her mother's clan), and born for the TiâaashcÃ­âÃ­ clan (Red Bottom People, her father's clan).
