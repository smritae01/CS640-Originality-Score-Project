Innti was an Irish language poetry movement, associated with a journal of the same name founded in 1970 by Michael Davitt, Nuala NÃ­ Dhomhnaill, Gabriel Rosenstock, Louis de Paor and Liam Ã Muirthile. These writers were students of University College Cork, drawing inspiration from SeÃ¡n Ã RÃ­ordÃ¡in and SeÃ¡n Ã Riada, as well as American influences such as the Beat movement and counterculture. Their reception was mixed, with Gaelic-traditionalists resenting their urbanism, social liberalism and Anglo-American influences. Background
 Some prominent Gaelic poets in the generation prior to Innti were associated with the journal Comhar. Among these, who were of relevance to Innti were SeÃ¡n Ã RÃ­ordÃ¡in and the author of NuabhÃ©arsaÃ­ocht, SeÃ¡n Ã Tuama. These writers were both from the County Cork area and Ã RÃ­ordÃ¡in especially introduced European-styles into Irish-language poetry and themes of modern urban life. Ã Tuama held seminars on Irish poetry at University College Cork where Innti was founded in 1970.
