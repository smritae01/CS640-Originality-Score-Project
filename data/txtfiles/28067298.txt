financial district of London, England. The street runs east-west and at its eastern end meets Threadneedle Street. The street is within the City of London and part of the London Bridge financial district.

Queen Street was part of a medieval thoroughfare linking the City of London with the suburbs to the east. In the Middle Ages, it formed part of the way between the Tower of London and Westminster Abbey. It became a commercial street in the 17th century, when wealthy merchants built spacious Georgian houses along it. In the 19th century, it became one of the most important streets in London for business, finance and commerce. The name Queen Street was given to it in honour of Queen Victoria in 1837.
