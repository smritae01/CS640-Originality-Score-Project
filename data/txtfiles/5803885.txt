Sam Poo (died 19 December 1865) was a Chinese bushranger in Australia who was active in New South Wales during early 1865. Poo emigrated to Australia in the early 1860s during the gold rush. Being an unsuccessful miner, he turned to bushranging. He robbed travellers on the GulgongâMudgee for several weeks. On 3 February 1865, Poo killed Senior Constable John Ward, who was looking for him. After the murder of Ward, the New South Wales Police organised a large-scale manhunt, which lasted two weeks and resulted in Poo being arrested and seriously injured during his arrest. Poo was tried two times after his arrest. The first time on 10 April, he was tried for shooting with intent to kill at Aboriginal tracker Henry Hughes during his arrest and he was found guilty by the jury. The second time on 10 October, he was tried for the wilful murder of John Ward and he was again found guilty by the jury. He was sentenced to death and he was executed by hanging on 19 December 1865. Poo was fictionalised in David Martin's novel The Hero of Too (1965) and since has been a theme of a circus show, a children's novel and
