Nick Albertson (born 1983, Boston, MA) is a Chicago-based artist. Themes 
 Primarily utilizing a Toyo-Field 45CF 4-by-5 camera, Nick Albertson's work combines photography, video, and sculptural forms. Albertson's recent body of work utilizes the repetitive patterning of everyday household items such as rubber bands, cups, straws, paper napkins, and plastic bags. When framed through Nick Albertson's photographic lens, these mundane objects undergo a transformation. Through patterning, light and shadow, sculptural formations, and post-production editing, Albertson's work blurs the lines between abstraction and representation, playing to the repetitive nature of the objects in question and the viewer's familiarity with common household products. "In my work, I strip utilitarian objects of their functions, repurposing them to create visceral experiences." One reviewer noted that in some of Albertson's works, it is obvious to tell which household or office item he is utilizing in his works. Others, not so much. The repeated motif leads towards abstraction in a way that is both mesmerizing and deceptive.
