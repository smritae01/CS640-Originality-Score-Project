meaning the point of land where the sea meets the land) is a headland on the east coast of the North Island of New Zealand. It is located in Rodney District, Bay of Plenty.

The point is named after Achilles, one of the heroes in the Trojan War. The headland was first sighted by MÄori in about 1250 AD, and was later known to European mariners as Point Venus (after the Roman goddess of love). In 1814 a British sealing station was established on Venus Bay, about 2 km south-east of the point. In 1857 a beacon was erected to help ships find their way into the bay. In 1865 a lighthouse was erected on Venus Bay at Achilles Point. The lighthouse was automated in 1976 and decommissioned in 1995.

The headland is a popular tourist destination, with walks, views and beaches all within easy reach. The nearby town of Pukerua Bay is well known for its wine and seafood.
