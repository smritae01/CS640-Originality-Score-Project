HarperOne is a publishing imprint of HarperCollins, specializing in books that aim to "transform, inspire, change lives, and influence cultural discussions." Under the original name of Harper San Francisco, the imprint was founded in 1977 by 13 employees of the New York Cityâbased Harper & Row, who traveled west to San Francisco to be at the center of the New Age movement. Harper acquired the religious publisher Winston-Seabury from CBS in 1986. Harper San Francisco changed its name to HarperOne in 2006, and expanded its core book categories beyond religion and spirituality to include health and wellness and inspirational non-fiction.
