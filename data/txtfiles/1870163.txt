known as the Laws of Hywel Dda, is a set of laws attributed to the legendary Welsh king Hywel Dda. The laws are considered to be one of the most influential legal systems in medieval Europe.

The Laws of Hywel Dda were compiled in the early 10th century and are thought to have been based on earlier law codes from the 7th century. The laws were largely unenforced until the late 12th century, when they were used to try and reform Wales. The system was eventually abandoned in the early 14th century, with the rise of English law.

The Laws of Hywel Dda are a collection of general principles of law, covering a wide range of subjects such as property, contract, torts, and criminal law. They are considered to be one of the most influential legal systems in medieval Europe, and have been influential in subsequent legal systems throughout the world.
