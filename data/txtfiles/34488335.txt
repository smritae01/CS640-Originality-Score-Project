Crane's early work in philosophy focused on the philosophy of language, including work on meaning and reference. He also developed the first version of what came to be known as the lambda calculus. His later work in philosophy focused on the theory of computation, including work on computability and semantics. He also developed what is now known as the crane paradox. His work in philosophy of mathematics has been highly influential, particularly his book The Mathematical Theory of Games and Economic Behavior.
