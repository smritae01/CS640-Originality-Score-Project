The Central Connecticut Conference (CCC) is an interscholastic athletic conference in the Greater Hartford region of Connecticut, United States. History
 In July 1999 founding member Enfield High school would leave the CCC Conference to join the NCCC. E.O. Smith applied to join the CCC Conference in 1999 due to increasing enrollment, E.O. Smith would replace the departing Enfield high school. The Central Connecticut Conference or (CCC) went through major expansion in 2009 with a total of 32 schools participating in the conference. In the 2015â16 school year, Avon High School joined the CCC. This made the conference change back to three divisions of eleven teams, with a blue and a white section in each division, with one having five teams and the other having six. Avon High School moved from the NCCC, where they were the largest school. Some of their competitors were not large enough to have freshman and/or junior varsity teams for Avon to compete against, leading to their move. Avon High school would be replacing Fermi High School which closed its doors at the end of the 2016 academic year, Fermi would merge all of its sports with Enfield High
