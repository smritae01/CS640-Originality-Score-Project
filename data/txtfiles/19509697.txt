unsuccessful airplane design that was produced in the early 1920s. Designed and built by the Napier Aircraft Company, the Cub was a single-seat, low-wing monoplane with a conventional landing gear and a single engine. It was intended as a sport aircraft, but poor performance led to its only production being eight aircraft.
