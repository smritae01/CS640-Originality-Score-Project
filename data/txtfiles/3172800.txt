to raise awareness of the challenges and opportunities faced by international students and to celebrate the contributions they make to their communities and countries. International Students' Day is observed on the first Saturday of October.

International students bring a wealth of cultural experiences, knowledge, and skills to their host countries, and in turn contribute significantly to economic development and social well-being. They are also essential contributors to the academic and cultural life of their universities and colleges.

Despite their many contributions, international students often face significant challenges in their educational experiences, including language barriers, adjustment to a new culture, and insufficient support from their institutions. International Students' Day is an opportunity to raise awareness of these challenges and to celebrate the many contributions of international students.
